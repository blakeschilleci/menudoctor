# Restaurant Menu Redesign Service Website

This project is a website designed to provide a restaurant menu redesign service to customers. The website allows users to explore the services, contact the business, view an example of a redesigned menu, and sign up to request a redesign.

### Project Structure

This project consists of a simple front-end interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site includes the following pages:

- **Welcome Page**: Introduction to the service and a brief overview of the redesign offering.
- **Contact Us Page**: A form for customers to contact the business with inquiries or questions.
- **Example Redesigned Menu Page**: A showcase of an example redesigned menu to demonstrate the capabilities of the service.
- **Sign-Up Page**: Allows users to sign up for the menu redesign service.

## Project Overview

The project is intended to showcase a restaurant menu redesign service that can be expanded to include additional functionality in the future. The current iteration focuses on the front-end of the site and will include pages that allow users to learn about the service, view an example, and sign up for a redesign.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling of the website.
- **JavaScript**: Client-side functionality (e.g., form validation, interactive elements).

## Requirements

### Front-End:

- A **Welcome Page** that introduces the business and outlines the menu redesign service.
- A **Contact Us Page** where users can submit inquiries (simple contact form).
- An **Example Redesigned Menu Page** that visually demonstrates what a redesigned restaurant menu looks like.
- A **Sign-Up Page** with a simple form for users to sign up for the service (to be expanded later with backend integration).

### Future Back-End Features (To Be Implemented)

- User sign-up and authentication.
- Database for storing user information and sign-up details.
- Contact form submissions to be sent to a backend email or stored in a database.
- Integration with payment services for handling transactions.

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: User visits the website
- A user visits the website and is greeted with the **Welcome Page**, which explains the restaurant menu redesign service.
  
### Use Case 2: User browses example
- The user navigates to the **Example Redesigned Menu Page** to see a sample of a restaurant menu that has been redesigned by the service.

### Use Case 3: User contacts the service
- The user fills out the **Contact Us Page** form to ask questions or inquire about the service.

### Use Case 4: User signs up
- The user fills out the **Sign-Up Page** form to sign up for the menu redesign service, leaving contact information and any relevant details.

### Use Case 5: Future Features (To be Added)
- As the backend is developed, users will be able to log in, manage their account, track their redesign request, and potentially pay for the service.

## Future Development

- **Backend Development**: Integration of a backend to handle user sign-ups, menu design requests, and email submissions.
- **Payment Integration**: Add payment gateways for users to pay for the service.
- **Admin Panel**: For the business owner to manage customer requests, track redesign progress, and communicate with clients.
- **Portfolio Section**: Showcase a gallery of past restaurant menu redesigns.
- **Feedback System**: Allow users to leave reviews after using the service.

## Backend (To Be Implemented)

- **Authentication**: User registration and login functionality for customers.
- **User Management**: A backend service to manage user data, including their sign-up information and redesign requests.
- **Contact Form Handling**: A system to receive and process contact form submissions.
- **Payment System**: Implementing a payment gateway to allow customers to pay for services.

## Hosting (To Be Implemented)

- Hosting will be set up to deploy the website and make it publicly accessible.
- Possible platforms: 
  - GitHub Pages for a simple static website deployment (for initial iteration).
  - AWS, Heroku, or similar services for future backend deployment.
